# [Amat.su/kaze!](http://amat.su/kaze/)
A simple URL shortening service. Open-sourced because why the fuck not.

Has basic functionality such as:
* Using custom URL's instead of default hashes
* Storing number of hits on each hash (Still not viewable, on todo list)
* A copy button to copy shortened URL to clipboard

###Browser Extensions
Check out this repo for Chrome and Firefox extensions for amat.su!

###Todo
* Perhaps add a login system so people can keep track of their own url's
* Make a way so people can view how many hits each url has
