# [Amat.su/kaze!](http://amat.su/kaze/)
A simple URL shortening service. Open-sourced because why the fuck not.

Has basic functionality such as:
* Using custom URL's instead of default hashes
* Storing number of hits on each hash (Still not viewable, on todo list)
* A copy button to copy shortened URL to clipboard

### 2020 Edit
I've done something vaguely resembling CI with GHA and terraform so I can finally migrate this off some random server a friend hosts.
Fuck you, Docker.

### 2018 Edit
This project is 100% certified L O L D E A D
I'm willing to take PR's if anyone gives an astronomical amount of fucks to go through the effort of making one.

### Browser Extensions
Check out this repo for Chrome and Firefox extensions for amat.su! 
https://github.com/remiscarlet/amat.su-browser-extensions

### Todo
* Perhaps add a login system so people can keep track of their own url's
* Make a way so people can view how many hits each url has
